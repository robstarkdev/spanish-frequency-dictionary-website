        <span class="question">
            How many words are "ranked"? Are English words also ranked?

        <span class="question">
            What technologies did you use to build the app?
        </span>
        <br>
        I built it with React Native, and on the "server-side" I used Google Cloud and Firebase cloud functions.

        Yes, I can build virtually any kind of app you could possibly think of. My contact information is listed on the "About" page of this site <a href="about.php">here</a>.
